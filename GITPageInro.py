# Data Science Languages in Jupyter Notebooks
# 
# 1 .Python: Primary language for Jupyter Notebooks, with extensive support for data analysis libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
# 
# 2. R: Widely used for statistical analysis and visualization within Jupyter Notebooks, especially in academia and research.
# 
# 
# 3 Julia: Known for its high-performance computing capabilities, Julia is gaining popularity in data science, especially for tasks involving large datasets.
# 
# 

# Data Science Libraries for Jupyter Notebooks
# 
# 1 . NumPy:** Fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
# 
# 2. **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library offering data structures like DataFrame, making it easy to work with structured data.
# 
# 
# 3. **Matplotlib:** Comprehensive 2D plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks.

# ### Data Science Tools
# 
# 1. **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive and versatile tool for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
# 
# 2. **Anaconda:** Distribution of Python and R programming languages for data science, including a package manager and a variety of pre-installed libraries.
# 
# 3. **Tableau:** Powerful data visualization tool that allows users to create inte

# ### Arithmetic Expressions Examples
#  
#  **Addition:**
#  
#  **Subtraction:**
#  
#  **Multiplication**

#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[8]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
hours = 200/60
print(hours)
